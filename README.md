# KiraTron Grade Importer

    This project is a simple file manipulation program that: 

    - Prompts you for the date of the file and searches through the downloads folder (where the grade reports would download)
    - Searches for the file, finds it, and opens the file utilizing pandas csv methods. 
    - Reads the names of the students and compares against a file that held their student id number on the LMS
    - Adds the appropriate student ID in a column so that the file is readable by the LMS upload parser


    Future Plans: I would like to finish implementing this project in C++ for more advanced practice, but it takes less precedent than current large projects.
